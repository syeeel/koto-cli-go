        ## Report Unexpected Model Behavior
        
        Use this template when Claude does something unexpected, makes unwanted changes, or behaves inconsistently with your instructions.
        
        **This is for:** Unexpected actions, file modifications outside scope, ignoring instructions, making assumptions
        **NOT for:** Crashes, API errors, or installation issues (use Bug Report instead)
